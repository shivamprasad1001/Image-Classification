# üñºÔ∏è Image Classification Project

## üìù Overview
This project explores the fundamentals of **image classification** using a small dataset of **44 images** across **3 classes**. Due to the limited dataset size, the current model achieves an accuracy of approximately **29%**, providing an excellent opportunity to identify areas for improvement, such as dataset expansion, data augmentation, and model optimization.

## üìÇ Project Structure
- **`imageClassification.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the image classification model implementation.
- **`Images/`**: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing.

## üìä Dataset
- **Total Images**: 44 training images
- **Number of Classes**: 3 (e.g., Class 1, Class 2, Class 3)
- **Key Challenge**: The small dataset size restricts the model's ability to generalize, resulting in lower accuracy. Expanding the dataset is crucial for better results.

## üöÄ Model Performance
- **Current Accuracy**: ~29%
- **Limiting Factor**: The limited dataset size is the primary reason for the lower accuracy. With more data, the model could improve significantly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivamprasad1001/Image-Classification.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure all required libraries are installed. You can install the necessary libraries with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not available, install manually:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python
```

### 3. Run the Jupyter Notebook
To train and evaluate the model, navigate to the project directory and open the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook imageClassification.ipynb
```
Execute the cells to load the dataset, build the model, train it, and evaluate the results.

## üîß Improving the Model
If you'd like to enhance the performance of the model, consider the following steps:

1. **Increase the Dataset Size**: Collect more images to improve generalization.
2. **Use Data Augmentation**: Techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling images can simulate a larger dataset.
3. **Experiment with Different Architectures**: Try advanced models like **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** or **Transfer Learning** using pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust learning rates, batch sizes, and other hyperparameters for better performance.
5. **Cross-validation**: Implement k-fold cross-validation to provide a more reliable performance estimate.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following tools and libraries:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy** (for array operations)
- **Pandas** (for data handling)
- **Matplotlib** (for plotting and visualizing results)
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)

Install them by running:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python
```

## üìà Future Enhancements
There are several ways to further enhance this project:

- **Expand the Dataset**: Collect more data to make the model more robust.
- **Transfer Learning**: Use pretrained models like **ResNet** or **VGG** to leverage knowledge from larger datasets.
- **Deploy the Model**: Deploy the model using **Flask** or **FastAPI** to create a simple web app that allows users to upload images for classification.
- **Improve Optimization Techniques**: Experiment with advanced optimizers like **Adam** with custom learning rates for better convergence.
