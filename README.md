# Image Classification Project

## Overview
This project implements a basic image classification model using a small dataset of only 44 training images across 3 classes. Due to the limited dataset size, the current model achieves an accuracy of approximately 29%.

## Project Structure
- `imageClassification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the image classification model.
- `Images/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing.

## Dataset
- Total training images: 44
- Number of classes: 3
- Note: The small dataset size significantly impacts the model's performance.

## Model Performance
- Current accuracy: ~29%
- Note: The low accuracy is primarily due to the limited number of training samples.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/shivamprasad1001/Image-Classification.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook imageClassification.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Improving the Model
To enhance the model's performance, consider the following steps:
1. Increase the dataset size significantly.
2. Implement data augmentation techniques.
3. Experiment with different model architectures or transfer learning.
4. Fine-tune hyperparameters.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (list the specific libraries used in your project, e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, numpy, etc.)
